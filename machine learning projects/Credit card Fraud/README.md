STEPS:

Import Libraries: Load essential libraries for data manipulation and analysis.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Analyze data distributions, correlations, and class imbalances.

Feature Engineering: Create new features or modify existing ones to enhance model performance.

Anomaly Detection: Identify outliers in the data using statistical methods.

Isolation Forest and Outlier Capping: Apply the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect outliers and cap extreme values.

Resampling (Under and Over): Use techniques like SMOTE for oversampling and random undersampling to balance the dataset.

Model Selection: Choose appropriate models for training (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees).

Prediction: Make predictions on test data and evaluate model performance.
